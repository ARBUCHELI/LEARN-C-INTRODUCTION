* The C Programming Language
----------------------------
Congratulations on choosing to learn the C programming language! C has been around for quite some time and it is one of the foundational languages of computer science.

C is an older language compared to other languages in use and yet it is still very popular. The TIOBE Index, which measures the popularity of programming languages, has C at the top of 
the list for many years. This is due to C’s use in all areas of computing.

Most operating systems today including the Linux Kernel are implemented with C code. The main version of the Python programming language is named CPython because it is implemented using 
C. C has also been extended using the languages C++ and C#.

C is also common in embedded systems which are smaller computing units that control things like home appliances, lighting controllers, and other small physical devices.

The C programming language is everywhere. Learning it will help you become a better programmer ready for the next challenge in any field of computer science.
