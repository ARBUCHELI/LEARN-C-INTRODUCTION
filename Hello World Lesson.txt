# HELLO WORLD: LESSON
---------------------

* The C Programming Language
----------------------------
Congratulations on choosing to learn the C programming language! C has been around for quite some time and it is one of the foundational languages of computer science.

C is an older language compared to other languages in use and yet it is still very popular. The TIOBE Index, which measures the popularity of programming languages, has C at the top of 
the list for many years. This is due to C’s use in all areas of computing.

Most operating systems today including the Linux Kernel are implemented with C code. The main version of the Python programming language is named CPython because it is implemented using 
C. C has also been extended using the languages C++ and C#.

C is also common in embedded systems which are smaller computing units that control things like home appliances, lighting controllers, and other small physical devices.

The C programming language is everywhere. Learning it will help you become a better programmer ready for the next challenge in any field of computer science.

The workspace shows the C programming language’s reach throughout the computing landscape. Through the code in operating systems, other programming languages, and embedded systems, C is 
everywhere!

* Hello World
-------------
So let’s look at our first C program!

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // output a line
  printf("Hello World!\n");
}

When this code is run the following text is displayed in the terminal.

Hello World!

Let’s go through the code line by line to see what is happening. You don’t need to understand everything right away, this is just a first look.

	. #include <stdio.h>: This line is needed to run the line of code that starts with printf.

 	. int main(){ }: This is the starting point of the code. All the code inside the curly braces {} runs first.

	. // output a line: This is a comment. It is not a line of code but a message we can add to code to tell ourselves or others what the code does. When the code is run this line 
	will be ignored.

	. printf("Hello World!");: This line of code prints, or outputs, the text “Hello World!” to the console. Printing text to the console is one way for a program to communicate with 
	the user.

Try running the code and see the output yourself!

The Hello World code located in the workspace in the file script.c.

Run the code to see the text output in the console.


Hint
Run the code in script.c.

script.c
--------
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // output a line
  printf("Hello World!\n");
}
